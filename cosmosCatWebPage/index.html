                One day, you encounter the Three Cosmos Cats. These enigmatic beings offer to take you on a journey through their multidimensional universe, where you can witness the stunning patterns formed by different types of motion. However, there's a catch. To embark on this journey, you must pet the cats in the correct order, which requires you to solve mathematical puzzles.

                As you pet the cats, they transport you to different parts of the universe, each showcasing unique and beautiful patterns. These patterns are visual representations of the motions I explored: straight constant motion, acceleration motion, trigonometric motion, and circular motion. Each dimension you visit is a testament to the beauty of these mathematical concepts.

                But beware! If you touch the cat toy, the cats will become distracted and forget everything they are doing. You will be returned to the original state when you first met the cats, and you will have to start your journey anew.
